What is Commercium?



Commercium is a platform that ensures the most secure and efficient data processing, storage and access. The Commercium Blockchain Platform will offer a customized virtual wallet that enables consumers and businesses to easily incorporate blockchain into their financial transactions and any information tracking activities. A secondary, independent blockchain is currently under development and the Commercium Platform will have a dual chain offering.


What is the purpose of Commercium?

The Commercium (i) blockchain or CMM, is an entirely new genesis of the Bitcoin coinbase, intended for simple transactions of value, speed, privacy and security are the roots of the CMM blockchain. Consumers must become familiar with blockchain and distributed ledger technologies so that organic demand for these tools can drive integration into commerce. Functionalities that enable individuals to pull demand for these services, will prompt corporations and businesses to meet the needs of their customers rather than pushing unusable or complicated platforms. Commercium will work directly with the user base and community members to create intuitive, easy-to-use applications so that consumers can become fluent and confident in the blockchain based tools they use.

Commercium (CMM) Features



The Commercium (i) blockchain will implement the ZeroCoin protocol, a form of zero-knowledge proofs delivered through RSA accumulator encryption methods. Masternodes will offer additional network stability and strength, bolstering the distributed ledger and are currently in development. CMM will function as a payment medium, and is intended for simple, real-time consumer-to-business (C2B) and business-to-business (B2B) transactions of goods, services and value.
